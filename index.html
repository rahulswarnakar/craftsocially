Brown color obtained from the bark of the Arjuna tree. Thus different colors are collected from different fruits. Step- 1 Fruits and bark are cleaned after collection from the tree. Should be cleaned otherwise various insects and spoiled fruit coloring can cause problems. Different types of fruits and peels are separated. Step- 2 After separation, the fruit and bark are boiled separately in water. After boiling for one hour, the water has to be filtered so that no pieces of bark or fruit remain. If bark or pieces of fruit remain, it will be difficult to color the jute. After bending, the color water should boil for a while more. When the color of the water becomes dark, it should be stopped. Step- 3 Jute should be immersed in colored water for a while. The jute color should be dipped in water five to six times and one to two minutes should be allowed between each dip. Step- 4 After dipping in the paint, it should be dried in the sun for a few hours. Once the jute is dry it is ready to wrap on the structure. "

The Purpose of the Study is to assess the Steps of Production System In today’s Craft Loving World. Indigenous Resources For Crafting Dhokra: a) For Making the Form b) For Firing Supply Chain for Form Making:- Honeybee wax, Brass Scrap, Dhuno/Dhup, Mustard Oil, Sand, China Clay, Coal, Cow Dung, Wood, and Brick. These are Procurement from the Local Market of Gushkara. ** For Firing: China Clay Crucible, Coal, Cow Dung, Wood and Brick The Procedure: Firstly the Clay Model is made & Dried.  Further, the wax threads are wound around the Clay Model.  Upon the wax Coating a Layer of Clay is applied.  Two holes are made and the model is dried. The Moulds are Getting Sun Dried After the model gets Dried up, again a layer of Sand with Clay Is applied. This Model is Further Baked in Furnace Then the Molten metal (Brass) Is Poured through a Channel. After Molten Metal gets Hardened inside, it is dipped in water.  The outer Layer of Burnt Clay Mould Is Removed. Lastly, the Metal Article is Polished and Sold.  A clay mixture of mud, cow dung and water of appropriate ratio is kneaded thoroughly for the required consistency. Using this mixture of clay a core model is made. Upon this model a pure form of clay is applied as a layer for the smooth finishing. This model is allowed to dry completely. By using lengthy wax threads the whole clay model is completely wrapped with it to form a layer and to obtain the selected pattern of design. On this coating of wax layer, a layer of clay with sand is applied. Usually sand is used here for the purpose of tightness in the mixture. Two channels like holes are made on it and allowed to dry. In these two channels, one channel is made to pour the molten metal hence the other channel is automatically used for releasing the air out. After the clay model is completely dried, a layer of sand mixed with minimal amount of clay is applied. Thus the clay-wax model is totally set ready to bake. The model is thoroughly baked in furnace and the wax in-between the layers of clay gets melted and remains as a hallow space between the layers of clay. Further this model is taken out from the furnace and through a channel molten metal is poured into it. This molten metal is initially obtained by melting the metal crucibles in a graphite container. While heating/melting these metal crucibles a bit of salt is added to obtain the pure form of molten metal which also enhances the further process. The molten metal poured into the clay mold acquires the shape and pattern of the model and acquires the impression of the wax model in fine details. This metal further gets hardened between the layers of upper and inner surfaces of the clay mould. Thus it is dipped in water to cool down the temperature of the metal. Once it is cooled completely then by slightly hammering and brushing the burnt mold, the metal artifact is thoroughly cleaned from both inside and outside. It is further polished all around and sold in market.  Durga Idol: Tribal Kerala Boat: "

This Context emphasize on transition of sitar morphology, physical development , organic materials and various terminologies of Sitar. The art of making stringed instruments in Dadpur has been traditionally carried on from generation to generation, from primitive stage to this modern age. Manufacturing stringed instruments is itself a creative process which cannot be Static,hence the gradual developments and experiments have always given new ideas to the modern generation. Transition And Physical Development of Sitar The word “Setar” is a Persian One. In 13th century during the reign of Giasuddin Balvan the great Poet Aamir Khusroo entitled Kachchapi, Tritantri Vinas as “Setar” in general. Basically, the word “Setar” is synonymous with “Tritantri “in Persian language “se” means three. The structure of tritantri vina is a like Kanchchapi Vina. That is why now a days three stringed Instruments like Kanchchapi vina are Denoted as “Setar” By Mid-19th Century Sitar was familiar for solo performance and accompanied with vocal and Dance. It has 3 strings, metal frets and was played with a mizrab. It had touchy tonal quality that used to please the listeners. But the next development of the instrument actually took place from the later part of this century. It almost took a period of 100 years for the sitar instrument to get its modern Shape, Size and mechanism. Various regional influences have got some effect on the physical development of the instrument and as a result a number of varieties were developed. It is believed that until later part of 19th century the sitar instrument totally made of “Paper Mache”.

This is large hard gourd, roughly 14 inches in diameter. There are two ways that the gourd may be cut and mounted on the sitar. The most common has the base of the gourd running perpendicular to the face.  Tabkadi (Faceplate) It is Probably the most important wooden piece of the sitar. It is made of single piece. It is very important that the grain of the wood run in the direction of the tabkadi. It is also very important that this would be free of knotholes or other imperfections.

Designs are meticulously carved by hand into the blocks which are approximately 18-25 cm across. The physical block is the design for a single repeat which is then stamped in rows across the fabric. Each colour in the design is carved into a separate block. The outline block or ‘rekh’, is the most intricate and usually stamped first; it is typically the outline for a floral or lattice type design. Next comes the fill block or ‘Datta’ and possibly the ground colour block or wood depending on the colour scheme used. Block carving is in itself an art requiring years of apprenticeship to gain mastery and is done entirely by hand. Process Firstly, a design is drawn on the paper which is going to be carved on the wooden block. These designs can be inspired by Sanganeri prints, Mughal prints, motifs, etc. After the design drawing, the design is traced and carved on the wooden blocks by hand. The block craving is done separately for individual colour. E. g. If two colours i. e. ‘yellow’ and ‘red’ are being used in the design, then woodblock carving is done on two individual blocks for different colours. The woodblock carving is done carefully and requires years of experience and apprenticeship to gain mastery, leaving behind the required design carved beautifully.  "

    "title": "Hand Block Print in Jaipur, Rajasthan",
    "body": "2020/07/09 - Block printing is a way of creating coloured designs on fabric using wooden blocks. The hand block printing process involves block printing craftsmen or women using wooden or sometimes metal blocks that each has a particular pattern carved on them to stamp on plain fabrics.  Sometimes several layers of patterns in different colours are printed over each other to create multi-coloured designs. The process of hand block printing: The hand block print process includes the following steps: Step -1 Washing The fabric brought from the market contains starch, dust etc. Therefore it goes through a preprinting treatment in order to get good results while printing. The fabric is therefore dipped in a solution of water and bleach for 1-2 days. It is then boiled and washed with water. Finally the cloth is stretched and spread on ground and left for dying. This process known as hari sarana takes 3-5 days depending on the weather condition.  Step-2 Marking The cloth to be printed is spread on the printing table and fixed with the help of pins. With help of scale and chalk areas to be printed are marked and proper gaps are left for cutting and stitching.  Step-3 Printing Printer dips the block in the color and stamps the design on the cloth. The blocks are then pressed hard with the fist on the back of the handle so that registration/imprint of the color is even. Printing starts from left to right. Number of color used in the design defines the number of blocks to be used. Generally one printer handles one color and application is done simultaneously. In the case of sarees the pallu is printed first and then the border. First the outline color is applied and then the filling colors. Specific point in the block guides the printer for the repeat impression. The process of printing is called as chapaai.  Step-4 Drying After the printing is completed the fabric is dried out in sun for the colors to get fixed. This is done specially for the pigment dyes. The printed fabrics are handled with utmost care so that the colors are not transferred to other areas. Therefore they are wrapped in plastic or newspaper after drying. The process is called as sukhaai.  Step-5 Washing Fabric then goes through the process of steaming in the boilers constructed for this purpose. After steaming, the material is washed thoroughly in large quantities of water and dried in the sun. Once the fabric is washed and dried ironing is done, which further fixes the color permanently. This final process of washing is called Dhulaai.  First, the lengths of fabric are treated with bleach and water before being boiled and left to dry in the sun. This removes the starch and dust from the cloth. Then the textile is stretched on the printing board and the areas to be printed are marked out with chalk. The hand block print process begins with the printer setting up his chosen ink trays, dipping the block in colour and stamping the design on the cloth. Solid systematic “thump thump” resounds as he prints from left to right, as per the custom, and the number of blocks depends on the various colours used in the design. According to the hand block print thumb rule, the outline colour is always applied first and then the rest of the design is filled out. This stamping process is called chapai. After the printing process, the fabric is sun-dried for the colours to hold fast and then it is steamed in special boilers before drying out in the sun. A finished, dried fabric is ironed out before getting ready for packaging and the entire process takes more than a week. "

Dadpur Village of Uluberia is the centre of growing industry for Indian Musical Instruments where majority of inhabitants Earn their living from making musical instruments. Consequently, the village has emerged as a major exporter of instruments and their various Parts. Since Last few Decades, this remote village has started its own model of a home-grown music industry.  Tarapada Halder, a native of Dadpur village has started off this flourishing trade. This was way back in the Mid-20th Century when the Music Industry was undergoing a massive change. There hardly existed any shop for buying such instruments. Most importantly, none of them had an individual manufacturing unit. Their business just dealt with buying and selling according to market demand. Tarapada Halder left for Lucknow and spent a lot of time in Grasping the Nature of this trade. He could comprehend and develop a command over the business of musical instruments very well. He returned from Lucknow and engaged in manufacturing them himself. Next, he went to recruit the youths of Dadpur Village for Assistance and taught them the art of making musical instruments.

However, after the instrument made by them are sold to instrument companies, the craftsmen hardly get any credit or acknowledgement.

Hence its give a clear view that the civilization was capable of using lacquer technology knowing its physical and chemical properties. Moghul period: I have information that lacquer is mention in ‘Aain-E-Akbar’ written by Abdul Fazal in 1950 AD.  The Sankhari, Traditional lacquer Artisan Of Balasore Three families are associated with the history of the Lacquer Doll.  One is Sen Family, another is Dutta family and third is Chand family. The ancestor of the family was doing the job there as their occupation. Next-generation of the families is no able to properly identify their ancestors though they have preserved the sweet memories of making lacquer doll in the core of their heart. These three families were near the Budha Kartika in Barabati area The present generation of the families are now residing at Barabati and Nalamganj. The following genealogy comes to knowledge from the physical survey.
